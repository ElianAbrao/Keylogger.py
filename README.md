# Keylloger.py
Directory dedicated to the creation of a Keylogger, made in Python language

Initially the project is a simple keylogger, without sending the records to another computer, just recording keystrokes (within a computer user).

Objective features: 
- Clean code 
- Lightweight 
- Expandable  
- "Work in secret" (background)

Technologies: 
- Key logging 
- Code output command 
- Key recording, saved in Notepad

Methodology: This project is being carried out exclusively by me (Elian Bressan Abr√£o), I'm creating this project with educational purposes, because I chose this theme precisely because I don't know how to do it, thus learning while I program and elaborate.
