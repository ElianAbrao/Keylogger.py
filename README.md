Methodology:
    This project is being carried out exclusively by me (Elian Bressan Abrão), I'm creating this project for educational purposes, since I chose this theme precisely because I don't know how to do it, however I learn while I program and elaborate. For this reason I'm using content as references in this youtube video lessons project from some people, I would like to leave some credits to the appropriate people for their help.
